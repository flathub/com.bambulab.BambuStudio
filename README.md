# BambuStudio

This Flatpak tries to stick as close to possible to the versions required
by BambuStudio's build scripts. We, however, will update dependencies if
it fixes build problems.

# Common issues

- Window Manager titlebar is visible in addition to app titlebar ([upstream issue](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/3313))
- Lack of Wayland support ([upstream issue](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/2595))
- Huge amount of GTK warnings on startup ([upstream issue](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/3315))

# Reporting problems

Unless problems don't occur with the [BambuLab-provided AppImage](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/releases), please
[file bugs directly with the upstream project](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues).

# Saying thanks

Note that the initial version of this Flatpak took a couple of week-ends,
and many, many evenings to fix and upstream the 150+ patches necessary to
get it building and most of the expected functionality working.

If you're using BambuStudio from Flathub, and want to make sure I need
to keep it up-to-date, I've set up a [3D-printing related wishlist](https://www.amazon.fr/hz/wishlist/ls/3A4WBDMGAOEDS?type=wishlist&filter=unpurchased&sort=price-asc&viewType=list).
